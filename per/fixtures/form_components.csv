33,,"Information and Communication Technology (ICT)  ","- NS has a plan to ensure the continuity of ICT functions essential for a response during epidemics (e.g. availability of essential staff, or resources needed to carry out rumour management or CBS  activities).","- NS has alternative means for communication in place, as ICT infrastructure might be particularly affected in urban areas and the remaining infrastructure struggles to meet the high demand after disaster, thus limiting the ability to reach stakeholders and the affected population.","- Nothing additional to consider."
34,,"Logistics, Procurement and Supply Chain  ","##### LOGISTICS MANAGEMENT 
- NS consults WHO and MoH on pre-positioned relief item specifications related to epidemics which contributes to the analysis of optimal supply chain options with suppliers in terms of cost, speed, reliability, and environmental impact. 
- NS is prepared to manage the impact of lockdown, possible disrupted supply chain of essential items, and limited availability of onsite logistics-related staff/volunteers. 
- NS has SOPs for accepting, rejecting, storing, disposing, and reporting on in-kind medical donations. 
##### SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT 
- NS has supply chain management processes that are adapted to epidemics, (e.g. with pre-identified trusted suppliers for critical items such as PPE or cholera kits). 
##### PROCUREMENT 
- NS has clear processes for local procurement of medical items and other supplies, and qualified health personnel assess the items’  quality in consultation with IFRC logistics if necessary. 
##### FLEET AND TRANSPORTATION MANAGEMENT 
- NS has infection prevention and control measures in place for the use of vehicles and other relevant facilities during epidemics (e.g. fleet office, drivers’ room). 
- Drivers are included in infection prevention and control and psychosocial support training in epidemics. 
##### WAREHOUSE AND STOCK MANAGEMENT 
- NS has warehousing and stock management procedures adapted to epidemics. If medical items and other supplies are in use (and especially if it has an expiration date), NS has dedicated HR,  technical capacity and appropriate physical space to manage it during and after the epidemic, including rotating or donating items to prevent losses.","##### LOGISTICS MANAGEMENT 
- NS has identified alternative transport and access routes in the case of damaged or collapsed urban infrastructure (e.g., bridges,  roads, etc.). 
- NS has pre-identified supplier agreements domestically to support a scale-up of operations, taking advantage of the increased access to service providers in urban contexts. 
- NS has pre-identified supplier agreements internationally to support a scale-up of operations in the event domestic sources are unavailable.","##### LOGISTICS MANAGEMENT 
- The NS logistics and procurement systems involve checks on the environmental sustainability of needed products and services. 
- The logistics and procurement system includes policies to reduce waste associated with single-use plastic and packaging.  
##### PROCUREMENT  
- Procurement and contract documentation includes reference to environmental standards and related considerations. 
##### FLEET AND TRANSPORTATION MANAGEMENT 
- The NS has a fleet tracking system to monitor efficient vehicle use,  and drivers have undergone fuel-efficient driving training.  
- NS transportation procedures ensure that appropriate vehicles are used according to the context, to reduce fuel consumption and carbon emissions e.g., not using 4-wheel drive vehicles unless necessary. 
##### WAREHOUSE AND STOCK MANAGEMENT 
- The NS has a relief item pre-positioning plan with an adequate stock rotation system to avoid wasting materials that are not used within their shelf-life period."
35,,"Staff and Volunteer Management","- NS conducts regular training of key staff and responders on epidemic prevention and control at all levels (HQ, high-risk branches, volunteers).  
- NS takes measures to protect staff and volunteers, by limiting their risk of exposure or enhancing safety and protection measures (e.g. vaccination of staff/volunteers, provision of PPE).  
- NS checks local labor laws to identify if specialized skills are required to carry out particular tasks during epidemics.
- NS response staff and volunteers are insured during epidemics and  NS informs/deploys them accordingly (NB: in general, insurance policies for volunteers do NOT cover epidemic risk). 
- Mental health and psychosocial support arrangements are available for response teams or other staff and volunteers to help them manage stress/stigma during/after an outbreak.","- NS provides training to responders on how to manage urban disasters (e.g., training can cover how to conduct needs assessments, ways to improve coordination among a higher number of stakeholders, etc.). 
- NS has sufficient equipment and protective material for responders to manage urban disasters. 
- NS is able to rapidly scale up operations with an increased number of responders that have sufficient background and training on how to manage the complexity of urban disasters. 
- NS has procedures in place to accept and manage a high volume of spontaneous volunteers or has agreements with organizations that are better placed to support this function.","- The NS includes basic climate and environmental awareness within the staff and volunteer mandatory training."
36,,"Communication in Emergencies  ","- Key risk messages are developed/adapted and shared with staff and volunteers regularly for public dissemination during epidemics.

- NS has an in-depth analysis of communication networks in the urban context to track negative publicity and tackle it.","- Nothing additional to consider."
37,,"Resource Mobilisation","- NS has identified potential partners that can provide in-kind  donations during epidemics (e.g. PPE).","- Nothing additional to consider.","- The NS has identified potential sources of funds associated with addressing environmental issues in disaster management."
